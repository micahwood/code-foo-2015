I am going to assume you are wanting a Fermi estimation (thanks for teaching me that word XKCD) as an answer to this question. In that case I would estimate that a 747 carries around 300-400 passengers. Let's go with 400. I'm going to assume that a ping pong ball is about 2 in on each side or 8 in^3, and henceforth treat them like ping-pong cubes.

When I fly on a plane, I fly coach. Stepping into the seat I have to lower my head a tiny bit to avoid hitting the overhead compartment. I'm 6 ft 1, so the seat height is probably 6 ft tall. My knees rest just short of the upright seat in front of me, and I know that the distance from my back to my knees is 2 ft so I'll round down the length to be exactly 2 ft because my mind only works in ints. Lastly we have the width, shoulder to shoulder I am about 18 inches and I fit comfortably width wise in that seat, so the width is probably 2 ft as well. That gives us a volume of 41472 in^3 per coach seat to fill with ping pong cubes. We should be able to fit 5184 of them in that space, and with 400 chairs that would come out to be 2073600 from the seats.

Airplanes also have aisles which aren't accounted for in that previous calculation. A 747 has two aisles, with the seats in a 3 4 3 arrangement I believe. I'll just treat the aisle like it's another seat, which would increase the number of seats per row from 10 to 12, or a 20% increase. That brings our seat total up to 480 and the ping pong ball count up to 2488320.

Lastly there is the overhead and bag storage compartments. If everyone is allowed one carry on bag then one would assume they have space in the overhead compartments for everyone's bag. My carry on bag is 20in x 18in x 10in so 3600 in^3. The aisles don't have overhead compartments, but they also have more head room, so I'll treat the extra space like an overhead compartment. That would give us space to hold 480 bags, or 1728000 in^3, which is enough room for another 216000, bringing our current total up to 2704320 ping pong shapes.

I've never seen the bag storage compartment on a 747 but I know they were flying those things when it used to be free to check bags, so it is probably big. Since I've never seen how large that area is I'll assume that it's 25% of the planes total volume. That would give us a grand total of 3380400 ping pong balls.

Hopefully the purpose of this question wasn't to spend 2 minutes looking up the volume of a 747 and going from there.
